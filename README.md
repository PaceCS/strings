# Arrays

In this assignment, you will be working with strings via arrays.  You will be creating a function that transforms a string in each of the files **countVowels.js**, **snakeCase.js**, **reverseString.js**, and **palindrome.js**.  The

### countVowels
The input to **countVowels** will be string.  Your function should log the string as well as the number of vowels in that string.

Input:

```
Hello
```

Output:
```
You entered 'Hello'.
It has 2 vowels.
```
---

Input:

```
My name is Sarah.
```

Output:
```
You entered 'My name is Sarah.'.
It has 6 vowels.
```

### snakeCase
The input to **snakeCase** will be a string.  Your function should log the string as well as return the string in snake case.

Input:

```
Hello Joseph
```

Output:
```
You entered 'Hello Joseph'.
In snake case, your string is helloJoseph.
```
---

Input:

```
My name is Sarah
```

Output:
```
You entered 'My name is Sarah'.
In snake case, your string is myNameIsSarah.
```

### reverseString
The input to **reverseString** will be a string.  Your function should log the string as well as log the string in reverse.  It should also include a `return` statement at the end that returns the reversed string.  This will be used in the next function.

Input:

```
Hello
```

Output:
```
You entered 'Hello'.
Your string reversed is 'olleH'.
```
---

Input:

```
My name is Sarah.
```

Output:
```
You entered 'My name is Sarah.'.
Your string reversed is '.haraS si eman yM'.
```

### palindrome
A palindrom is a word that is spelled that same forwards and backwards, ignoring capitalization or spaces.  For example, 'racecar' and 'Anna' are palindromes.   So is, 'a nut for a jar of tuna'.  The input to **palindrome** will be a string.  In your case, you can assume that it is just one word - no need to consider multiple words.  Your function should log the string as well as determine whether the string is a palindrome.

Input:

```
Hello
```

Output:
```
You entered 'Hello'.
It is not a palindrome.
```
---

Input:

```
madam
```

Output:
```
You entered 'madam'.
It is a palindrome!
```

---

Input:

```
Anna
```

Output:
```
You entered 'Anna'.
It is a palindrome!
```
